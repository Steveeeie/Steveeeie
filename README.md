# Hello! I'm Steve <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Steveeeie/vanilla-js-parcel-starter/master/src/robot.gif" alt="" width="100" />

I lead front-end teams and build accessible, performant, well-tested products. With 16 years of experience, I've delivered for brands like Sky, FIFA, and The Macallan. I work with businesses on a contract basis through my company, Eulersoft.

Here you'll find example projects showcasing my development approach, resources for others to learn from, and open source apps you can contribute to.
